<h1> ListMerging documentation</h1>
<p>Function Name: merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)
Input: Two lists: list1, list2, both lists are assumed to be sorted in ascending order.
Output: A new sorted list which contains all elements from both list1 and list2.
Function Description: This function takes in two sorted lists, list1 and list2, and merges them into a new sorted list. The function uses a while loop to iterate through both lists at the same time and compare the elements. If an element from list1 is smaller than the corresponding element from list2, it is appended to the merged_list and the index i is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the element from list2 is appended to the merged_list and the index j is incremented by 1. After the while loop completes, any remaining elements from list1 and list2 are appended to the merged_list. Finally, the merged_list is returned.
Example: list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7] list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8] merged_list = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2) print(merged_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Note: The function assumes that both input lists are sorted in ascending order. If the input lists are not sorted, the output list may not be sorted correctly.

<h1> RandomNumber Generator </h1>

<p>Function Name: generate_random_numbers
Description: This function generates a list of n random integers between lower_bound and upper_bound (inclusive).
Parameters: n - An integer that specifies the number of random integers to generate. lower_bound - An integer that specifies the lower bound of the range from which the random integers are generated (inclusive). upper_bound - An integer that specifies the upper bound of the range from which the random integers are generated (inclusive).
Return: A list of n random integers between lower_bound and upper_bound (inclusive).
Example:
random_numbers = generate_random_numbers(10, 1, 100) print(random_numbers) [55, 89, 42, 93, 68, 49, 95, 44, 6, 80]

 <h1> RomanNumber Conversion </h1>
 
 <p> Function Name: roman_to_int
Description: This function takes a Roman numeral string as input and converts it to an integer value.
Parameters: roman_numeral - A string that represents the Roman numeral to be converted to an integer.
Return: An integer value that represents the equivalent of the Roman numeral.
Example:
roman_numeral = 'XXIV' integer_value = roman_to_int(roman_numeral) print(integer_value) 24
Notes: This function uses a dictionary to map each Roman numeral character to its corresponding integer value. It then iterates through each character in the input string and calculates the corresponding integer value by comparing the current value to the previous value. If the current value is greater than the previous value, it subtracts twice the previous value to handle cases like 'IV' or 'IX' correctly.
