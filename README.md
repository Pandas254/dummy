<h1> ListMerging documentation</h1>
<p>Function Name: merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2)
Input: Two lists: list1, list2, both lists are assumed to be sorted in ascending order.
Output: A new sorted list which contains all elements from both list1 and list2.
Function Description: This function takes in two sorted lists, list1 and list2, and merges them into a new sorted list. The function uses a while loop to iterate through both lists at the same time and compare the elements. If an element from list1 is smaller than the corresponding element from list2, it is appended to the merged_list and the index i is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the element from list2 is appended to the merged_list and the index j is incremented by 1. After the while loop completes, any remaining elements from list1 and list2 are appended to the merged_list. Finally, the merged_list is returned.
Example: list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7] list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8] merged_list = merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2) print(merged_list) # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
Note: The function assumes that both input lists are sorted in ascending order. If the input lists are not sorted, the output list may not be sorted correctly.
